//! Implements the legacy `BatteryStatus` feature (ID `0x1000`) that reports a
//! device's battery charge as a discharge level plus a charging status.
//!
//! This is the predecessor of `UnifiedBattery` (`0x1004`): older mice such as
//! the MX Master 2S expose `0x1000` and never `0x1004`, so the inventory probe
//! falls back to this feature when the unified one is absent — the same
//! enhanced-then-legacy pattern `SmartShift` uses for `0x2111` / `0x2110`.
//!
//! Only `getBatteryLevelStatus` (function `0`) is implemented; the optional
//! `getBatteryCapability` (function `1`) and the broadcast event aren't needed
//! to display a charge reading.
