//! Cross-platform single-instance process guard.
//!
//! On startup a process tries to acquire an exclusive, non-blocking lock on a
//! named file under the user's data dir. Holding the lock keeps a second
//! invocation of the *same* role from running — the GUI uses it to avoid a
//! duplicate window, the background agent to avoid two processes fighting over
//! the same devices and IPC socket. Each role passes its own lock file name so
//! the GUI and the agent don't lock each other out. The lock is released by the
//! OS when the process exits, so crash-recovery is free: the next launch
//! reclaims the lock on the leftover file without any cleanup ceremony.
